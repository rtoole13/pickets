	Blocks path
Pass
	allows mountain crossing at default speed

Woods

	Can relocate?
	Spawns couriers for issuing orders

	Has a skirmish/picket radius
		- greater than combat radius
	has a sight radius
		- greater than or equal to skirmish/picket radius
Cavalry unit
	double speed
	brigades and divisons possible

Courier
	Unit that issues orders


/---------------------AI---------------------/

Will require A* pathfinding
	Will be implented by all military units and couriers

!Generals must be fairly smart
!If cavalry exists in the game, you must either be able to issue queued, yet flexible, orders or assume
!that they will have the means of escaping a tricky situation. (Think Stuart's 2nd round o' McClellan, 
!first during the Seven Days, second after more than a month of immobility following Antietam)

/---------------------Combat---------------------/
!Will need some implementation of fog of war

Units could have a march mode where they move faster, suffer an initial serious blow if surprised
!In general, even in 'battle lines' suffer some hard initial blow if you discover an enemy real close

!Need some way to visualize skirmishing vs full scale engagement

Artillery can fire on entwined units at risk to one's own troops

Need a visual/mechanical way to 'lock' units in combat.. Also need a way to lock more than just 1v1
	- When a unit is 'locked' can they disengage?
		- Perhaps so at serious cost? Hold out for the end of the day otherwise?

/-----------------Unit Modes---------------------/
Marching
	- Lessened sight radius to skirmish radius (encourage flanking units with cavalry)
	- Decreased offense/defense
Battle lines
	- After a period of immobility, units naturally enter into normal, defensive state
		- Period of time unmoved determines stage (i.e after 5 sec, 'in line', 5 more for 'fortified')
	- 2.5 stages
		- transition (time of immobility before first stage)
		- in line
		- fortified
Retreat
	- Terrible debuff


Notes:

	When an enemy marches into a stationary enemies, the marching army enters into the transition state immediately
	The stationary enemy's state is fixed in time wherever it's at immediately


/-----------------------Time---------------------/
Actual time, fighting after a point at night becomes nearly impossible somehow..
	- Bivouacked units have fairly extensive pickets, but a large defensive penalty
	- Any aggressors suffer more readily from desertion 
	- All units suffer morale penalty
	- Everyone's sight is limited
	-

Alternative or eventuality in any decided upon setup: End of day hard stop to combat
	- Combatants are somehow retreated to skirmish distances
	- Battle may resume next day - some cumulative morale score is tallied and dealt out come morning
	- Could have scale of engagements die down towards evening too 
		- Could have a a system in which commanded generals gently refuse orders when asked to do something
		  dramatic towards day's end
  			- This could be overcome, to an extent, by particularly high morale

Time introduces some easy forced 'win conditions' or general constraints. For instance, perhaps the scenario
is that you are far into enemy terratory in which the enemy vastly outnumbers you. You must clear an individual
battle particularly quickly or risk enemy reinforcements




/---------------------Scales---------------------/
Brigade
	Cannot be divided
	Smallest Unit, default at 3000 men

Division
	Can be divided into brigades if above certain threshold
	Default at 4 brigades == 12000 men

Corps
	Can be divided into divisions if above certain threshold
	Default at 2 divisions == 24000 men


/----------------Artillery Scales----------------/
Battery
	cannot be divided
	default at 6 guns
Battalion
	Can be divided into batteries if above certain threshold
	default at 2 batteries == 12 guns





/----------------Major questions----------------/
Scope..
	How high level is the command to be?




/--------------Major enforcements---------------/
/---General game points---/
Advantage to defender
Flanking advantage
Route under rapid destruction
Presence of officers effect on morale and rally
Advantage in cover
	- Granted in two forms
		- Sight advantage, jump on the enemy
		- More rapidly reach 'fortified' state

/---More esoteric points---/
Skirmishing/pickets and visibility
	- Units can engage in skirmishing outside of their combat radius
		- Doing so will result in a steady, very slow reduction in 
		  engaged units health

Heavy defenses are far from impenetrable. It doesn't take as many men to 
take a position as the history textbook would indicate..
	- Still look to Lanchester's laws for rough guidelines

Absurd strength of artillerly
	- decimate forces if not treated properly
		- not sure how this will function yet
