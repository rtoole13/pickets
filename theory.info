NOTE KEY - Any line flagged as such has an affiliated concern/suggestion
! : Important 'realistic' military element I very much want enforced

/---------------------Terrain---------------------/
Field
	Move throughout at default speed
Road
	Move along at increased speed


River
	Blocks path
Bridge
	allows river crossing
	at default speed
Ford
	allows river crossing
	at decreased speed

Hills
	Conceals to greater extent
	Move throughout at default speed
	Provides combat advantage
Mountain
	Blocks path
Pass
	allows mountain crossing at default speed

Woods
	Conceals to greater extent
	Provides combat advantage

/-------------------GameObjects-------------------/
General
	Commanding general's location
	Can relocate?
	Spawns couriers for issuing orders

Infantry unit
	base speed
	all unit scales possible
Cavalry unit
	double speed
	brigades and divisons possible
Artillery unit
	base speed
	unique scales

Courier
	Unit that issues orders


/---------------------AI---------------------/

Will require A* pathfinding
	Will be implented by all military units and couriers

!Generals must be fairly smart
!If cavalry exists in the game, you must either be able to issue queued, yet flexible, orders or assume
!that they will have the means of escaping a tricky situation. (Think Stuart's 2nd round o' McClellan, 
!first during the Seven Days, second after more than a month of immobility following Antietam)

/---------------------Combat---------------------/
!Will need some implementation of fog of war
!Need to get picket/skirmish action into the game somehow
Units could have a march mode where they move faster, suffer an initial serious blow if surprised
!In general, even in 'battle lines' suffer some hard initial blow if you discover an enemy real close

!Need some way to visualize skirmishing vs full scale engagement

Artillery can fire on entwined units at risk to one's own troops

Need a visual/mechanical way to 'lock' units in combat.. Also need a way to lock more than just 1v1
	- When a unit is 'locked' can they disengage?
		- Perhaps so at serious cost? Hold out for the end of the day otherwise?

/-----------------Unit Modes---------------------/
Marching
	- Lessened sight radius (encourage flanking units with cavalry)
Battle lines
	- Can't remain in battle lines indefinitely
Bivouack
	- After not marching/battling for a period of time, naturally enter this state.

Retreat

/-----------------------Time---------------------/
Actual time, fighting after a point at night becomes nearly impossible somehow..
	- Bivouacked units have fairly extensive pickets, but a large defensive penalty
	- Any aggressors suffer more readily from desertion 
	- All units suffer morale penalty
	- Everyone's sight is limited
	-

Alternative or eventuality in any decided upon setup: End of day hard stop to combat
	- Combatants are somehow retreated to skirmish distances
	- Battle may resume next day - some cumulative morale score is tallied and dealt out come morning
	- Could have scale of engagements die down towards evening too 
		- Could have a a system in which commanded generals gently refuse orders when asked to do something
		  dramatic towards day's end
  			- This could be overcome, to an extent, by particularly high morale

Time introduces some easy forced 'win conditions' or general constraints. For instance, perhaps the scenario
is that you are far into enemy terratory in which the enemy vastly outnumbers you. You must clear an individual
battle particularly quickly or risk enemy reinforcements




/---------------------Scales---------------------/
Brigade
	Cannot be divided
	Smallest Unit, default at 3000 men

Division
	Can be divided into brigades if above certain threshold
	Default at 4 brigades == 12000 men

Corps
	Can be divided into divisions if above certain threshold
	Default at 2 divisions == 24000 men


/----------------Artillery Scales----------------/
Battery
	cannot be divided
	default at 6 guns
Battalion
	Can be divided into batteries if above certain threshold
	default at 2 batteries == 12 guns





/----------------Major questions----------------/
Scope..
	How high level is the command to be?
